## Visual Search

Implementing a classic neuroscience visual search study that contrasts the effect of pop-out search vs conjunction search on response time. Typically, response times for pop-out tasks will be constant time because the target should "pop out" almost immediately; for constrast, in conjunction search response times will be linear because distractors can match on shape or color, but a distractor will never match on both features because that will make it indistinguishable from the target!

The task implementation is a series of plots of 'X's and 'O's that can be contrasting colors. The target is specified on the plot at all times. If you see the target (or don't), there are specific buttons you will press described by the on-screen instructions. After a certain number of correct trials, your results will be displayed showing your response times for pop-out search vs conjunction search.
